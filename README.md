This is the frontend code of Useful Sites. Useful sites is a MERN Stack based application where people can share a common list of useful URLs. 

## Current Feature List: 

1. Basic CRUD operation for every list item. That Means, anyone can at this moment Add, Edit and Delete sites from the list.

## How to run it on your own machine:

If you just want to work with the frontend then this repo will be fine. You are also free to use the backend express API for this application.

However, if you want to make some changes in the backend, then you can find the code [here](https://github.com/AyushmanBilasThakur/useful_sites_backend).

The API endpoint is exposed at: [https://useful-sites-backend.glitch.me/](https://useful-sites-backend.glitch.me/)

You can change the URL to backend API in the `src/constants.js` with the `API_URL` constant.
